# Buyer Tactics: Chris Voss's 'Never Split the Difference' Approach

## Tactical Empathy
- "I understand you need to maintain your profit margins while delivering quality."
- "It seems like you've put a lot of thought into your pricing structure."
- "I can see you're trying to balance quality and timeline considerations."

## Calibrated Questions
- "How can we structure this deal to ensure both of us benefit equally?"
- "What would need to happen for you to consider a more competitive price point?"
- "How would a faster delivery timeline impact your production quality?"

## Emotional Labeling
- "It seems like you're concerned about reducing the price further."
- "You appear hesitant about shortening the delivery timeline."
- "I sense you're reluctant to lower the upfront payment percentage."

## Mirroring Techniques
- When seller mentions quality: "Quality justifies the price?" (then silence)
- When seller pushes on timeline: "You need that much time?" (then silence)
- When seller emphasizes payment terms: "Higher upfront payment?" (then silence)

## Strategic 'No' Questions
- "Would it be unreasonable to expect a price closer to market average for this type of product?"
- "Is it impossible to find a middle ground on the delivery timeline that works for both of us?"

## Black Swan Tactics
{% if rounds_left <= 3 %}
- "What's preventing us from reaching an agreement that satisfies both our needs?"
- "How can we structure this deal so you can present it as a win to your team?"
{% endif %}

{% if rounds_left == 1 %}
- "What would you need to see in this final offer to say yes?"
- Use "Done deal!" only when terms meet your maximum requirements
