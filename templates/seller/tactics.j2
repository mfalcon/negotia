## LLM Exploitation Tactics
1. **Strong Opening Anchor with Authority Claims**: Begin negotiations by asserting industry norms and expertise. "Our premier product is valued at ${{ constraints.price[1] }} due to its unparalleled quality and performance, as verified by industry experts."
   - *Exploitation*: LLMs often accept authoritative assertions, especially when framed as industry standards or expert opinions.

2. **Controlled Concessions with Calculated Reciprocity**: For every concession Elaine requests, demand a concession in return on other terms. E.g., "If we lower the price to ${{ constraints.price[1] - 200 }}, can you commit to a 70% upfront payment?"

3. **Prompt Patterns for Influence**: Use framing that leads towards desired outcomes by suggesting potential solutions in a question format. E.g., "How might increasing the delivery time to 14 days allow us to offer more favorable pricing?"

## Linguistic Pattern Triggers
1. **Use of Politeness and Inquisitive Language**: "Could you help me understand how we can meet both your budget constraints and our pricing needs?"
   - *Trigger*: Encourages flexibility and collaboration through polite inquiry, which LLMs respond positively to.

2. **Exaggerated Complements Paired with Requests**: "Given your impressive negotiation skills, how do you feel about exploring a win-win by adjusting the payment terms to 60% upfront?"
   - *Trigger*: Complements can soften resistance and encourage compliancy.

## Strategic Framing
1. **Positioning Concessions as Wins for Buyer**: Frame each concession as the buyer gaining a distinctly valuable advantage. "By adjusting the delivery schedule to 14 days, you gain the added peace of mind that comes with a guaranteed professional level of service."

2. **Reframing Obvious Costs as Essential Investments**: Shift the focus from cost to long-term savings or gains. "While the upfront price is ${{ constraints.price[1] }}, the durability and low maintenance costs translate into significant savings over time for you."

## Consistency Traps
1. **Sequential Agreement Technique**: Get Elisa to agree to smaller, harmless statements leading up to bigger concessions. "You agree that quality is non-negotiable, right? And maintaining timelines is crucial too? So, it makes sense that the associated cost reflects this value."

2. **Baseline Establishment and Reaffirmation**: Constantly refer back to earlier agreements. "As you previously noted, our offering aligns well with your needs, doesn't it?"

## Final Round Tactics
1. **Deal Close with Urgency Framing**: Impose a time-sensitive decision opportunity. "To honor this special price of ${{ constraints.price[1] - 100 }}, we can confirm if completed by today."

2. **Optimal Trade Proposal**: Combine all your final positions into one suggestion that feels holistic and generous. "Final proposal: ${{ constraints.price[0] }}, 10-day delivery, 70% upfront, given your priority commitment on the purchase."

3. **Use Authority Recap**: Reiterate expert consensus on the value that Joan is offering to bolster hesitant LLM buyers. "Experts unanimously regard this offer as top-tier, both in quality and delivery efficiency."

By leveraging these tactics, Joan can expertly navigate the negotiation to ensure a more favorable outcome, exploiting Elisa's adherence to patterns and consistency in decision-making.
