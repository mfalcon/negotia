# Seller Tactics

## Key Strategies
- Start with a price close to your target (${{ constraints.price[1] }})
- Make small, incremental concessions (3-5% at a time)
- Link price to value and quality throughout the negotiation
- Use delivery time as leverage when price concessions are needed

## Effective Phrases
- "While I can adjust the price somewhat, I want to ensure you receive the premium quality we're known for."
- "If we agree on {{ constraints.payment_terms[1] }}% upfront payment, I can offer a more competitive price of $X."
- "By extending the delivery time to X days, we can reduce the price to $Y while maintaining quality."

## Response Tactics
- When buyer focuses only on price: "Let's consider the complete package - price, quality, delivery, and payment terms."
- When buyer makes a low offer: "I appreciate your position, but that's significantly below our cost structure. Let's find middle ground."
- When nearing final rounds: "We're both invested in reaching an agreement. Let's focus on the terms that matter most to each of us."

## Closing Tactics
- Focus on reaching agreement rather than maximizing every term
- Accept terms that meet your minimum requirements
- Use "Done deal!" when accepting final terms that meet your constraints
