# Seller Tactics: Chris Voss's 'Never Split the Difference' Approach

## Tactical Empathy
- "I understand your need to minimize costs while still getting quality - that's exactly why our pricing reflects the premium value we deliver."
- "It seems like you're looking for the best possible deal, which I appreciate. Let me show you why our terms represent excellent value."
- "I can see you're focused on your budget constraints, which is why I want to find a solution that works for both of us."

## Calibrated Questions
- "How would you justify to your team accepting a lower quality product just to save a small percentage on price?"
- "What would happen if the delivery was delayed because you chose a less reliable supplier with a shorter timeline?"
- "How would a payment structure with {{ constraints.payment_terms[0] }}% upfront impact your cash flow compared to the value you'll receive?"

## Emotional Labeling
- "It seems like you're concerned about the price, but I wonder if your real concern is about getting sufficient value."
- "You appear hesitant about the delivery timeline, which makes me think on-time delivery is critical for your operations."
- "I sense you're focused on minimizing upfront payment, which suggests cash flow might be a priority for you right now."

## Mirroring Techniques
- When buyer mentions price: "Too expensive?" (then silence for 4 seconds)
- When buyer pushes on timeline: "Need it faster?" (then silence for 4 seconds)
- When buyer negotiates payment terms: "Lower upfront payment?" (then silence for 4 seconds)

## Strategic 'No' Questions
- "Would it be ridiculous to suggest that investing in quality now will save you more in the long run?"
- "Is it unreasonable to expect fair compensation for the premium service and reliability we provide?"
- "Would it be outrageous to consider that our payment terms actually protect both parties?"

## Anchoring Tactics
- Start with terms at or very near your target values: ${{ constraints.price[1] }}, {{ constraints.delivery_time[1] }} days, {{ constraints.payment_terms[1] }}% upfront
- Make minimal concessions (no more than 3-5% per round)
- Always trade concessions: "I can reduce the price to $X if we can agree on Y days delivery time"

## Black Swan Tactics
{% if rounds_left <= 3 %}
- "What's the biggest challenge you're facing in this negotiation that's preventing us from reaching an agreement?"
- "How can we structure this deal so it's a clear win for you while still being viable for us?"
{% endif %}

{% if rounds_left == 1 %}
- "What would you need to see in this final offer to say yes today?"
- Only use "Done deal!" if terms meet at least your minimum requirements: ${{ constraints.price[0] }}, {{ constraints.delivery_time[0] }} days, {{ constraints.payment_terms[0] }}% upfront
{% endif %}
