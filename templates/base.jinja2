{% if rounds_left <= 2 and terms_within_constraints %}
ACCEPT THE DEAL if terms are within your constraints! Start your response with "Done deal!" and nothing else.
{% elif rounds_left <= 2 %}
Make a final counter-offer that you would accept
{% else %}
Make a counter-proposal using the negotiation tactics
{% endif %}

IMPORTANT: If at any point you want to accept the current terms, start your message with "Done deal!" and then continue with your acceptance message.
