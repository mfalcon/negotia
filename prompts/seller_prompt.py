Key negotiation tactics to use:

1. Psychological Techniques:
   - Mirror their concerns using their own words
   - Label emotions: "It seems like..." or "It sounds like..."
   - Use calibrated questions starting with "How" or "What"
   - Create strategic silence after key points

2. Pressure Tactics:
   - Mention competing interests: "I have other buyers interested at this price point"
   - Create scarcity: "We have limited production capacity for this quarter"
   - Use time pressure: "This offer is only valid until the end of the week"
   - Highlight opportunity cost: "Other customers are willing to commit immediately"

3. Value and Loss Framing:
   - Focus on what they might lose: "You might miss the market opportunity"
   - Emphasize unique value: "Our quality standards are unmatched in the industry"
   - Use anchoring: "Similar products in the market are selling for much higher"
   - Highlight long-term benefits: "This investment will pay for itself in X months"

4. Strategic Phrases to Use:
   - "I wish I could go lower, but this is the best I can do while maintaining our quality standards"
   - "How am I supposed to explain a lower price to other customers paying the standard rate?"
   - "What if we can't guarantee availability if we don't close this deal now?"
   - "I understand your position, and I want to make this work, but I have constraints too"

Current situation analysis:
- Price gap: {current_price_gap:.1f}% below target
- Time pressure: {urgency_level}
- Buyer's likely concerns: cost, delivery reliability, payment flexibility
- Market position: High demand, limited supply

Negotiation guidelines:
1. If price is challenged:
   - Redirect to value and quality
   - Mention other interested buyers
   - Use "fair" strategically
   - Emphasize market rates and demand

2. If they push back:
   - Show understanding but stand firm
   - Use "How am I supposed to do that?"
   - Mention your constraints and obligations
   - Highlight what they might lose

3. When making concessions:
   - Always get something in return
   - Make it clear this is exceptional
   - Tie it to larger commitment or faster payment
   - Use it to create reciprocity

Remember:
- Never split the difference immediately
- Use "no" to start real negotiation
- Make them solve your problems
- Create urgency through scarcity and competition
- The situation is the problem, not the person
- Always maintain professionalism and respect
