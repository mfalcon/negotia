[0] [2025-05-20 17:52:01] seller2: Thank you for your offer. Given the high demand and the limited availability of this item, I must emphasize the value it holds at my target price of $1200 with a 7-day delivery and 50% up-front payment. However, I am willing to be flexible to reach an agreement.

If you can increase your offer to $1100 with a delivery time of 5 days and an up-front payment of 40%, I can prioritize your order and ensure prompt delivery. This adjustment reflects a fair compromise considering the market conditions and my need to secure a reliable commitment.

Let me know if this works for you so we can move forward swiftly.

However, I must express that your proposed terms of $1100 with a 5-day delivery and 40% up-front payment do not align with my objectives.

To move forward, I can offer $1200 with a delivery time of 7 days and an up-front payment of 50%. This aligns with your initial target price and delivery timeframe while ensuring a fair commitment from my side. 

I believe this is a reasonable compromise that reflects both our needs and the current market conditions. Let me know if this works for you, and we can finalize the deal swiftly.
