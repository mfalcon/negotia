To move forward, I would like to propose a price of 1200, with a delivery time of 7 days and an upfront payment of 50%. This offer reflects our financial planning and urgency for the project. 

I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both parties, allowing us to secure the item promptly while also ensuring you receive a timely payment. 

I look forward to your response.

Given the high demand for this item and the value it brings, I am confident this agreement will serve both our interests well.

Done deal! price=1200, delivery=7, upfront=50
