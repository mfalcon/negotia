To meet halfway, I can offer the price at $1100 if you agree to a delivery time of 7 days and an upfront payment of 40%. This ensures I can prioritize your order while maintaining quality and service standards. Let me know if this works for you.
[1] [2025-05-20 17:51:50] buyer2: Thank you for your offer. I appreciate the competitive price of $1100 and the 7-day delivery. However, I need to discuss the upfront payment. Given our budget constraints, I can only agree to a 50% upfront payment if you can meet me at a price of $1200. This would allow us to move forward while ensuring that both parties feel comfortable with the terms. 

Let me know if you can accommodate this adjustment.
