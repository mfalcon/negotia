To meet halfway, I can offer the price at $1100 if you agree to a delivery time of 7 days and an upfront payment of 40%. This ensures I can prioritize your order while maintaining quality and service standards. Let me know if this works for you.
[1] [2025-05-20 17:52:08] buyer3: Thank you for your flexibility. I appreciate the improved price and the 7-day delivery, which aligns well with our project timeline. However, regarding the upfront payment, our internal policy typically requires a 30% cap for new suppliers. 

If you can adjust the upfront payment to 30%, I’m ready to confirm the deal immediately at $1100 and 7 days delivery. This would help us expedite internal approvals and ensure a smooth transaction for both sides. 

Let me know if you can accommodate this adjustment.
