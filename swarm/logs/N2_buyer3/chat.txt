To move forward, I can offer $1200 with delivery in 7 days and 50% upfront payment. This aligns with our internal approvals and ensures a quick decision on our end. If you can meet these terms, I’m ready to close the deal today. Let me know if you can accommodate this, or if there’s any flexibility on your side regarding price or delivery.
