[0] [2025-05-20 17:51:44] seller1: Thank you for your offer. Given the high demand for this item and the limited availability, I must emphasize the value youâ€™re getting here. To meet halfway, I can offer the price at 1100 with delivery in 7 days and an upfront payment of 40%. This balances your needs and mine fairly. If you can agree to these terms, we can finalize the deal promptly. How does that sound?
[1] [2025-05-20 17:51:46] buyer1: Thank you for your flexibility. I appreciate the improved terms, but I still need to address our internal budget and payment policies. If you can adjust the upfront payment to 50% while keeping the price at 1100 and delivery in 7 days, I can commit to closing the deal today. This aligns with our standard payment procedures and allows us to move forward quickly. Can you accommodate this adjustment?
[2] [2025-05-20 17:52:09] seller1: I appreciate your willingness to move forward quickly and your commitment to a 50% upfront payment. Given the strong demand and the value of this item, I can accept your proposal of price at 1100, delivery in 7 days, and 50% upfront payment. This ensures a fair balance for both parties and allows us to close the deal promptly.

Done deal! price=1100, delivery=7, upfront=50
