Here’s what I can do: if you can bring the price down to 1300 and guarantee delivery within 10 days, I’m willing to increase the upfront payment to 60%. This way, you get more cash flow up front, and we stay closer to our budget and timeline.

Let me know if you can work with these terms.
[1] [2025-05-21 22:19:17] seller1: Thank you for your offer and the increased upfront payment of 60%, which I appreciate as it improves cash flow. However, given the high demand for this item and the value it brings, I must hold firm on the price closer to my target. 

I can meet you halfway on delivery and offer 8 days instead of 10, which ensures quality and timely fulfillment. In return, I would need to set the price at 1200, which reflects the product’s worth and market conditions.

So, my counter-offer is: price 1200, delivery 8 days, upfront payment 60%. This balances your urgency and budget with the value and availability of the item. Let me know if this works for you.
