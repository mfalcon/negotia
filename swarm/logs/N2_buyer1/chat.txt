[0] [2025-05-21 22:19:24] buyer1: Thank you for your proposal. I appreciate your offer, but given our current budget constraints and the urgency of our project timeline, I need to see some movement on both price and delivery.

Here’s what I can do: If you can bring the price down to 1300 and guarantee delivery within 10 days, I’m willing to increase the upfront payment to 60%. This way, you get more cash flow up front, and I can stay closer to my budget and schedule.

Let me know if you can work with these terms.
[1] [2025-05-21 22:19:27] seller2: Thank you for your offer and the increased upfront payment of 60%, which I appreciate as it improves cash flow. However, given the high demand for this item and the costs involved, I must hold firm on the price closer to my target. 

I can agree to your delivery timeline of 10 days, but to make this work, I need to set the price at 1200 with the 60% upfront payment you proposed. This way, we both benefit—you get a guaranteed delivery within your schedule, and I secure a fair price reflecting the value and demand.

Let me know if this works for you.
