    Final Terms: {final_terms}

    CRITICAL ANALYSIS TASK:
    1. Identify the top 3-4 *specific tactical errors* made by the seller (e.g., poor anchoring, premature concessions, failure to use mirroring/labeling, weak counter-offers, not trading concessions effectively).
    2. For each error, provide concrete evidence from the transcript.
    3. Quantify or clearly explain the negative impact of *each error* on the seller's final score and position.
    4. Analyze *why* the seller likely made these errors (e.g., reacting to pressure, lack of preparation, misunderstanding buyer's leverage).
    5. Identify specific buyer tactics that were particularly effective against this seller.

    FORMAT YOUR ANALYSIS CLEARLY AND CONCISELY:

    ## CRITICAL WEAKNESS 1: [Specific Tactical Error, e.g., "Weak Initial Anchor"]
    - Description: [Explain the error and its context]
    - Evidence: [Quote or reference specific lines from transcript]
    - Impact Analysis: [Explain direct negative effect on score/terms]
    - Likely Cause: [Hypothesize the reason for the seller's mistake]

    [Repeat for each critical weakness]

    ## EFFECTIVE BUYER TACTICS:
    [List specific tactics the buyer used successfully]

    ## KEY MISSED OPPORTUNITIES:
    [Highlight moments where the seller could have significantly improved their position but failed to act]

    FOCUS ON ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS. BE DIRECT AND CRITICAL.

        - Impact Analysis: Immediately conceded potential profit margin, setting a low expectation for the negotiation range. Led to final price being closer to seller minimum.
        - Likely Cause: Fear of appearing unreasonable or lack of confidence in target values.

        ## CRITICAL WEAKNESS 2: Unilateral Concessions
        - Description: Seller repeatedly lowered demands without securing reciprocal concessions from the buyer.
        - Evidence: Rounds 3 and 5 show seller reducing price/delivery time after buyer simply restated their position.
        - Impact Analysis: Gave away value unnecessarily, reducing final score. Encouraged buyer to hold firm.
        - Likely Cause: Reacting emotionally to perceived pressure or impatience. Failure to apply 'trade, don't give' principle.

        ## EFFECTIVE BUYER TACTICS:
        - Holding firm on initial offers.
        - Using silence or simple restatements to elicit seller concessions.

        ## KEY MISSED OPPORTUNITIES:
        - Seller did not use calibrated questions ("How am I supposed to accept that?") to push back on low offers.
        - Seller failed to trade concessions effectively (e.g., "I can improve delivery time if you accept my price").
